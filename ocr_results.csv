Conclusion.png,"Conclusion

Every system is built from a domain-specific language designed by the
programmers to describe that system. Functions are the verbs of that
language, and classes are the nouns. This is not some throwback to the
hideous old notion that the nouns and verbs in a requirements document
are the first guess of the classes and functions of a system. Rather, this is
a much older truth. The art of programming is, and has always been, the
art of language design.

Master programmers think of systems as stories to be told rather than
programs to be written. They use the facilities of their chosen
programming language to construct a much richer and more expressive
language that can be used to tell that story. Part of that domain-specific
language is the hierarchy of functions that describe all the actions that
take place within that system. In an artful act of recursion those actions
are written to use the very domain-specific language they define to tell
their own small part of the story.

This chapter has been about the mechanics of writing functions well. If
you follow the rules herein, your functions will be short, well named,
and nicely organized. But never forget that your real goal is to tell the
story of the system, and that the functions you write need to fit cleanly
together into a clear and precise language to help you with that telling.","Conclusion

Has Potential
All men are sent to the world with limitless
credit, but seldom draw to their full extent.

It is a tragedy to know that with over five billion people
on this planet today, only a minute percentage will ex-
perience a significant fraction of their true potential. Per-
haps you are a candidate for contributing to the wealth of
the cemetery. Your potential was not given for you to
deposit in the grave. You must understand the tremendous
potential you possess and commit yourself to maximizing it
in your short lifetime. What is potential, anyway?","1 Everything in Life Has Potential
